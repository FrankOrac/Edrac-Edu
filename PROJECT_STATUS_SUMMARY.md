# Edu AI Platform — Project Status Summary

## Current State of the Edu AI Platform

### Project Structure & Tech Stack
- **Backend (`apps/api/`):** Node.js (Express), TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL.
  - Modular, type-safe API routes for all major education domains (students, teachers, exams, CBT, analytics, etc.).
  - JWT authentication, role-based access, and OpenAI-powered endpoints.
  - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.
- **Frontend (`apps/web/`):** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animation).
  - Unified sidebar navigation (`Layout`) with links to all modules, including CBT Extra.
  - Modern, animated landing page (recently upgraded for premium look).
  - Pages for dashboard, login, CBT modules, and all core features.
- **Shared Packages:** Common UI components, types, and utilities.
- **Docs:** Developer guides and contribution instructions.
- **No top-level `README.md` found, but a detailed `Readme.md` exists with setup, structure, and feature highlights.**

### Key Features Implemented
- **AI-Powered Learning:** Adaptive testing, AI tutoring, and analytics.
- **CBT Extra Module:** Computer-based testing with CRUD for subjects/questions, timed exams, and analytics. Accessible from main navigation.
- **Full School Management:** Attendance, results, assignments, transcripts, notifications, events, inventory, library, forums, payments, certificates, alumni, and more.
- **Role-Based Dashboards:** Widgets and quick links for students, teachers, admins, parents.
- **Modern UI:** Mobile-first, PWA-ready, with animated, glassmorphic landing page and sidebar navigation.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based, with session persistence and role checks.
- **Extensible:** Designed for new modules and integrations (e.g., Google Workspace, video conferencing, SIS compatibility).

---

### Recent Fixes & Upgrades
- **Routing and Navigation:** Fixed login redirect logic and ensured CBT modules do not disrupt the original app flow.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** All CBT features (Test, Extra, Analytics) are now always accessible.
- **Landing Page:** Upgraded to premium, animated, interactive design using Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS.
- **Bug Fixes:** Resolved missing imports (e.g., `useRouter`), Prisma seed/type issues, and TypeScript errors.
- **Seed Data:** Default users (admin, teacher, student, parent, superadmin) are seeded for testing.
- **API Integration:** Axios used for frontend API calls, with environment variables for config.

### What’s Working
- **You can log in, be redirected to the dashboard, and access all modules via the sidebar.**
- **CBT Extra module supports CRUD for questions/subjects and is visually separated from the main flow.**
- **Modern, animated landing page is live.**
- **Role-based session and navigation logic are in place.**
- **Backend and frontend are integrated and running locally.**

---

### What Needs Attention / Next Steps
- **UI Polish:** Further refinement of design on dashboard, CBT, and other modules if you want a consistent premium look.
- **Role-Based UI:** More granular control of what each role sees (e.g., hiding admin features for students).
- **Testing:** Full end-to-end testing with seeded users for all flows.
- **Documentation:** Consider renaming `Readme.md` to `README.md` for convention and discoverability.
- **Upgrade Next.js:** You’re on 14.2.30, but an update is available (not critical but recommended for latest features and security).
- **Additional Integrations:** If you want to enable third-party integrations (Google Workspace, video, SIS), follow the README’s guide.

## Summary
Your Edu AI platform is a robust, feature-rich, and extensible SaaS for education, with a strong foundation in both backend and frontend. The CBT Extra module is fully integrated but does not disrupt the original app flow. The landing page and navigation are modern and interactive. Most core bugs and routing issues have been addressed.

**You are ready for further polish, deeper testing, and additional customizations or integrations as needed.**
