## Current State of the Edu AI Platform

### Project Structure & Tech Stack
- **Backend (`apps/api/`):** Node.js (Express), TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL.
  - Modular, type-safe API routes for all major education domains (students, teachers, exams, CBT, analytics, etc.).
  - JWT authentication, role-based access, and OpenAI-powered endpoints.
  - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with security middleware (helmet, rate limiting, CORS).
- **Frontend (`apps/web/`):** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animation).
  - Unified sidebar navigation (`Layout`) with links to all modules, including CBT Extra.
  - Modern, animated landing page with glassmorphic design and interactive elements.
  - Pages for dashboard, login, CBT modules, and all core features.
- **Shared Packages:** Common UI components, types, and utilities.
- **Docs:** Developer guides and contribution instructions.
- **Complete README structure with proper setup and feature documentation.**
