# Continuous Development Guide for Edu AI App

This document outlines the best practices for ongoing development, deployment, and scaling of the Edu AI App.

---

## 1. Branching Strategy
- Use `main` for production-ready code.
- Use `develop` for staging and integration.
- Feature branches: `feature/xyz`, bugfix: `bugfix/xyz`, hotfix: `hotfix/xyz`.

## 2. Pull Requests & Code Reviews
- Open a PR for every change to `main` or `develop`.
- Require at least one review before merging.
- Ensure all tests and CI checks pass.

## 3. Testing
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Use Jest/React Testing Library for frontend, Jest/Supertest for backend.
- Run `npm test` locally before pushing.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions automates linting, testing, and deployment.
- Deploy to staging on PR merge to `develop`.
- Deploy to production on PR merge to `main`.

## 5. Feature Flags & Modular Plugins
- Use feature flags for experimental features.
- Build new modules as plugins/packages for easy integration.

## 6. Documentation
- Update README and relevant docs with every feature.
- Maintain API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI) and user guides.

## 7. Release Management
- Tag releases with semantic versioning.
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes.

## 8. Security & Compliance
- Review dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Follow GDPR, FERPA, COPPA compliance as outlined in README.

## 9. Developer Onboarding
- New devs should read: README, this guide, and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Set up local dev with `docker-compose up` and `.env` files.
