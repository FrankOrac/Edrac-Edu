## Project Structure

- `apps/api/` - Node.js backend (Express, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL)
  - Modular route files for all major domains (students, teachers, parents, attendance, exams, results, assignments, transcripts, notifications, events, transport, inventory, library, forums, payments, analytics, gamification, certificates, alumni, groups, plugins, AI)
  - Type-safe endpoints, JWT auth, AI endpoints, role-based access
  - Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- `apps/web/` - Frontend (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS)
  - Pages for all modules, each using a unified sidebar navigation (`Layout`)
  - Role-based dashboard widgets and quick links
- `packages/` - Shared UI components, utilities, and types
- `docs/` - Developer guides, continuous development, and contribution docs

---

## Key Highlights

- **AI-Powered Learning** - Adaptive testing, personalized paths, intelligent tutoring
- **Complete School Management** - From attendance to alumni networks
